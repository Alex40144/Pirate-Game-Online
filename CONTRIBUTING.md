If you'd like to contribute to Pirate-Game-Backend, please keep it as helpful as possible and if it seems that someone is focusing on working on a single piece of code or an area of focus, allow them to do so without interruption by leaving their code alone.
Otherwise, help in any way you'd like!
Thanks.
