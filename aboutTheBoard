25:49 25x £200

Skull and Crossbones Rules:
1. At start of game, each player selects a letter and a number (out of A, B or C, and then 1, 2 or 3).
2. When a player lands on Skull and Crossbones, that player has to select either a letter OR a number.
3. Any player who has selected that letter or number has their balance go to 0, but it doesn't affect their bank
4. If two people who have the letter or number selected have a shield and both choose to use it, the action is blocked for all those affected
5. If two people who have the letter or number selected have a mirror and both choose to use it, the action is reflected back to the letter/number of the person who landed on Skull and Crossbones

E.g. Alex (B3) selects A. Ben (A1) and Charlie (A2) both have A, so both have their balance go to 0.
However, Ben and Charlie both have a mirror, and use it. Therefore, as Alex picked a letter, everyone who selected B at the start of the game goes to 0 instead of A.
